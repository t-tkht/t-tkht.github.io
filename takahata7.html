		<h1>Boarding mobility robots</h1>

		<h2>Mobile robot adapted to escalators and low-floor buses</h2>
		<img class="abst-image" src="img/bmr.jpg" alt="Boarding mobility robot" />
		<p class="abst">We report on a mechanism of a wheelchair type robot that can be adapted to escalators and low-floor buses. </ br>
		The transport capacity of the escalators is larger than that of elevators. The low-floor buses are suitable for wheelchair users; however, drivers of the buses need to set up a slope to pass through the wheelchair. In literature, many types of leg-wheel type robots were developed to overcome the barriers such as staircases and trains. To be adapted to escalators using three steps, the height difference between front and rear wheels are 400 mm. The step heights of the entrance of the low-floor buses are about 120 mm. </ br>
		Here we show a mechanism to be adapted to escalators and low-floor buses with limited number of actuators: five linear actuators and two driving wheels.</p>

		<h2>Ascending and descending large steps in public transportation</h2>
		<p class="abst">In order to realize an electric wheelchair that can get on and off a low-floor bus or universal cab from the road surface without a ramp, a boarding mobility robot was designed and prototyped, and experiments showed that it can climb up and down a 340 mm-high step.</p>
