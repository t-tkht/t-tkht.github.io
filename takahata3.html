		<h1>Coaxial imaging of color and thermal images</h1>

		<h2>A silicon-glass hybrid lens for simultaneous color-and-thermal imaging</h2>
		<p class="abst">We show that color and thermal images from the same viewpoint and of the same view angle can be taken using a silicon-glass hybrid lens that focuses visible and far-infrared (FIR) light. The lens was fabricated using silicon three-dimensional fabrication process. Color and thermal images were taken with the hybrid lens. The maximum and mean differences of the color and thermal image displacements were 0.42 mm and 0.26 mm, respectively. The maximum and mean values of the differences in angle were 2.0&deg; and 1.2&deg;, respectively.</p>

		<h2>Compact coaxial thermal and color imaging system with silicon-glass hybrid lens</h2>
		<p class="abst">Detecting human is one of the most important functions of service robots assisting human lives. Thermal images are useful to detect human. Since the number of pixels of the thermal imagers is smaller than that of color imagers, thermal images get more useful combined with corresponding color images. In this paper, we propose a compact optical system to obtain both thermal and color images simultaneously. The key is to use a silicon-glass hybrid lens, with which visible and far-infrared light can be focused. The focused light was split by a silicon plate. The thermal and color images were taken by a thermal and color imager, respectively. We experimentally showed that the focal plane was tuned by the position of the lens keeping the correspondence of thermal and color images.</p>
