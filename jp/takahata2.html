		<h2>Silison Fresnel lens for thermal imaging</h2>
		<img class="abst-image" src="../img/fresnel_lens.jpg" alt="silison Fresnel lens" />
		<p class="abst">We propose that thin and light-weighted silicon Fresnel lenses is suit for thermal imaging. We adopted a one-mask process with photolithography and inductive coupled plasma reactive ion etching (ICP-RIE) to fabricate silicon three-dimensional structure. Thermal image was taken with a Fresnel lens, which we designed with ray-trace method and fabricated with the three-dimensional (3D) fabrication process. Thermal cameras have been expensive because germanium lenses are difficult to be machined. Since the 3D fabrication process suits mass production compared with other method like multi-level lithography, competitive-price FIR optical systems can be realized. </p>

		<h2>Tilted Paraboloidal Reflective Lens for Far Infrared Sensor</h2>
		<img class="abst-image" src="../img/paraboloidal_lens.jpg" alt="tilted paraboloidal reflective lens" />
		<p class="abst">A tilted paraboloidal reflective lens for focusing far infrared (FIR) rays has been devised. Tilted paraboloids with smooth surface and vertical walls were fabricated by two-step etching using microloading effect with a mask which had rectangular openings of various sizes. FIR light was focused by a 30-degree-tilted paraboloid lens. The size of a real image of an FIR source was 110 µm, which agrees with a lens formula.</p>

		<h2>Varifocal Infrared Imaging Lens by Parylene-on-Liquid-Deposition</h2>
		<img class="abst-image" src="../img/infrared_pold_lens.jpg" alt="" border="0" />
		<p class="abst">We report varifocal infrared imaging lenses for miniature infrared cameras. A droplet of liquid paraffin is sandwiched between a silicon substrate and a thin film of Parylene. Parylene is deposited directly onto the droplet&rsquo;s surface. Two electrodes are fabricated on both sides of the lens. When a voltage is applied, electrodes attract each other and the liquid is pushed toward lens center. Consequently the curvature of the lens increases. The transmittance of the structure with 0.2 mm thick liquid paraffin was about 10%. Infrared images of human body emission were obtained. Images were clear even when the focal length was tuned. The focal length of the 7-mm-diameter lens shortened to 43% of its initial value.</p>
